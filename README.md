# SocialMedia_Influence_Maximization

This is a project on Social Media Influence Maximization. Here I used an Instagram dataset available on kaggle which lists more than 70,000 user accounts and lists metrics such as thier followers, following, engagement grade, follower growth rate e.t.c. It also provides information about the the interconnectivity of the accounts as a network. Utilizing the given data, I have formed network graphs and tried using various models like the linear thershold model and the Independent cascading model to simulate the graph after choosing K seed nodes to be active. I have used the greedy Hill Climbing Approximation to find the best K nodes/seed nodes to choose so as to maximize influence.

This project is based on these research papers and resources:

I have utilized the Instagram user dataset for Social Media Influence Maximization which I found on Kaggle:
